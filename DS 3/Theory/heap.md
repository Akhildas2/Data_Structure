# Heap Data Structure

## 1.Heap

A heap is a specialized binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues, where the highest (or lowest) priority element is always at the root. Here are the key points about heaps:

## 2.Heap Property

- **Max-Heap**: For any node \( i \), the value of \( i \) is greater than or equal to the values of its children nodes.
- **Min-Heap**: For any node \( i \), the value of \( i \) is less than or equal to the values of its children nodes.

## 3.Structure

- **Complete Binary Tree**: Heaps are usually implemented as nearly complete binary trees, where all levels are fully filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.

## 4.Operations

- **Insertion**: Adding a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.
- **Deletion**: Removing the root element (highest priority element in max-heap or lowest in min-heap) and restoring the heap property.
- **Heapify**: Adjusting the heap after an element change to restore the heap property.

## 5.Advantages

- **Efficiency**: Insertion, deletion, and access to the highest (or lowest) priority element are \( O(\log n) \), making heaps efficient for priority queue implementations.
- **Simple Structure**: Heaps are straightforward to implement using arrays, requiring minimal overhead beyond the array storage.

## 6.Disadvantages

- **No Efficient Search**: Unlike binary search trees, heaps do not support efficient search operations (e.g., finding a specific element).
- **Limited Sorting**: While heaps can be used for sorting (heap sort), they are not as versatile as other sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort in practical scenarios.

## 7.Applications

- **Priority Queues**: Heaps are widely used to implement priority queues due to their efficient \( O(\log n) \) time complexity for insertion and deletion of the highest (or lowest) priority element.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Used in algorithms such as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm.

## 8.Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Insertion: \( O(\log n) \)
  - Deletion: \( O(\log n) \)
  - Heap Construction: \( O(n) \)
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity of a heap is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the heap, due to the storage requirements of the elements themselves.
