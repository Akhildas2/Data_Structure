# Trie Data Structure

## 1.Overview

A Trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-based data structure used for efficiently storing and retrieving strings or keys associated with values.

## 2.Structure

- **Node Structure:**

  - Each node represents a single character of the keys.
  - Nodes may have references to child nodes for subsequent characters.
  - Nodes may store flags indicating end of a key and associated values.

- **Root Node:**
  - Topmost node, not representing any character, serving as the start.

## 3.Operations

1. **Insertion (Insert):**

   - Adds nodes for each character of the key.
   - Marks the last node for complete keys.

2. **Search:**

   - Traverses nodes based on key characters.
   - Checks for completeness at the end node.

3. **Deletion:**
   - Removes nodes for each key character.
   - Ensures Trie consistency.

## 4.Advantages

- **Efficient Prefix Search:** Ideal for autocomplete and dictionaries.
- **Space Efficiency:** Saves space for common prefixes.
- **Ordered Iteration:** Keys in lexicographical order.

## 5.Disadvantages

- **Space Complexity:** Uses memory, especially with long or many keys.
- **Complexity:** More complex than simpler structures.

## 6.Applications

- **Autocomplete:** Provides quick suggestions in search engines and text editors.
- **Spell Checking:** Efficiently verifies and suggests corrections in spell-checking tools.
- **Dictionary Implementations:** Manages word definitions and translations swiftly.
- **IP Routing:** Facilitates fast lookup and decision-making in networking.
- **Database Indexing:** Speeds up data retrieval based on prefix queries.
- **Genetic Sequencing:** Compares DNA sequences for bioinformatics applications.
- **Compiler Design:** Manages keywords and identifiers during code compilation.

## 7.Variations

- **Compressed Tries:** Consolidates nodes.
- **Ternary Search Tries (TSTs):** Three-way branching.

## 8.Time/Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(m) \), where \( m \) is key length.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n \cdot m) \), \( n \) keys, \( m \) avg. length.
