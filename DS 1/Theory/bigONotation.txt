1.What is Big o notation ?

    Big O notation is a mathematical concept used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Specifically, it characterizes the worst-case scenario in terms of the time or space an algorithm will take relative to the size of the input data.


     Key concept

        1.Time Complexity
            * Describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input.

        2.Space Complexity
            * Describes the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input.


    Common Big o Notations

        1.O(1) - Constant Time:
            *
