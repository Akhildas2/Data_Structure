1.What is Big O notation ?

    Big O notation is a mathematical concept used in computer science to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time complexity and space complexity.
    It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's resource usage (time or space) as the input size increases.


     Key concept

        1.Time Complexity
            * Describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input.

        2.Space Complexity
            * Describes the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input.


    Common Big o Notations

        1.O(1) - Constant Time:
            * The algorithm's execution time is independent of the input size.

        2. O(log n) - Logarithmic time :
            * The algorithm's execution time grows logarithmically as the input size increases.

        3. O(n)- Linear time :
            * The execution time grows linearly with the input size.
        
        4. O(n log n)- Linearithmic time :
            * The execution time grows in proportion to n log n.
        
        5.O(n^2)- Quadratic time 
            * The execution time grows quadratically with the input size.
        
        6.O(2^n)- Exponential time :
            * The execution time doubles with each additional element in the input.
        
        7.O(n!)- Factorial time :
            * The execution time grows factorially with the input size.       

2.Why Use Big O Notation?

    1.Performance Analysis: Big O notation helps compare the efficiency of different algorithms, allowing developers to choose the most efficient one for a particular problem.
    2.Scalability: It provides a way to predict how an algorithm will perform as the input size grows, which is crucial for applications that need to handle large data sets.
    3.Optimization: It assists in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing code by focusing on the parts of the algorithm that contribute the most to the overall complexity.

3.Applications 

    1. Algorithm Design: When designing algorithms, Big O notation helps ensure that the solutions are efficient and scalable.
    2. Data Structures: It is used to analyze the performance of different data structures (like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and their operations (insertion, deletion, searching, etc.).
    3. Performance Tuning: In software engineering, Big O helps identify inefficient code that needs optimization.
    4. Software Development: Developers use Big O notation to write efficient code that can handle real-world applications, especially where performance is critical, such as in web servers, databases, and real-time systems.
