## 1.What is Algorithm ?

An algorithm is basically a set of instructions, like a recipe.It's a way of breaking down a problem or task into a step-by-step process that a computer can follow.

## 2.why we use that ?

* **Solve problems:** 
1.They can be used to solve complex problems efficiently and accurately.
2.There are multiple ways to solve one problem.
* **Automate tasks:** They allow computers to do things automatically, without needing human intervention. This can save us time and effort.
* **Make decisions:** Algorithms can be used to make decisions based on data. This is becoming increasingly important in fields like artificial intelligence.

## 3.Application of Algorithm ?

- **Searching the web:** Search engines like Google use algorithms to find the most relevant websites for your search query.
- **Social media feeds:** Social media platforms use algorithms to personalize your feed, showing you content that you're more likely to be interested in.
- **GPS navigation:** GPS navigation systems use algorithms to find the best route for you to take, considering factors like traffic and distance.

## 4.Characteristics of Algorithm ?

* Well defined inputs and outputs
* Each step should be clear and unambiguous
* Language independent
