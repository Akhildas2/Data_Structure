1. What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is basically a set of instructions, like a recipe. It's a way of breaking down a problem or task into a step-by-step process that a computer can follow.

2. Why do we use algorithms?

* Solve problems:
  - They can be used to solve complex problems efficiently and accurately.
  - There are multiple ways to solve one problem.
* Automate tasks:
  - They allow computers to do things automatically, without needing human intervention. This can save us time and effort.
* Make decisions:
  - Algorithms can be used to make decisions based on data. This is becoming increasingly important in fields like artificial intelligence.

3. Applications of Algorithms

- Searching the web:
  - Search engines like Google use algorithms to find the most relevant websites for your search query.
- Social media feeds:
  - Social media platforms use algorithms to personalize your feed, showing you content that you're more likely to be interested in.
- GPS navigation:
  - GPS navigation systems use algorithms to find the best route for you to take, considering factors like traffic and distance.

4. Characteristics of an Algorithm

* Well-defined inputs and outputs
* Each step should be clear and unambiguous
* Language independent
